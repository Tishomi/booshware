# Home Lab Setups
This is an outline of my home lab setup that I made over the course of the class.

I Orignally had everything under a simple setup with out segmentation. In order to learn the material I decided to sandbox the different devices that are connected to my network. I needed to have area where I could just burn to the ground if needed without affect the daily lives of the household. That opened up an opportunity to buy a new toy. I needed something small but with plenty of resources to run everything I wanted to experement with so that led me to a minipc powered by an AMD 7745H Cpu with 96GB ram, 2xTB NVME SSD's running Proxmox VE. I plan on running a few simulations were a total loss is possible, It is segmented away from an unaware of my other legs of my network. I took the time to move all IoT devices to there own section.
